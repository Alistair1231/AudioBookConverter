To change one of the exising presets, just change its parameters, they will be saved automatically and preset could be used next time
To create new preset select one of the existing presets, which will be used as a baseline, start typing preset name in text box, hit Enter when finished. How you have new preset and you could tune it accordingly
AudioBookConverter can open following format: mp3, m4a, m4b (aac/alac, with chapters information), flac (with track information from .cue), ogg (vorbis/opus), wma, wav.
AudioBookConverter can convert to following formats: m4a, m4b (aac), mp3, ogg (opus).
OGG format with opus codec will provide the best size to quality ratio, however, it's not supported by all book players.
Your computer may become less responsive during encoding as AudioBookConverter uses all available CPU/Cores for encoding.
To find art work AudioBookConverter checks all incoming media files and tries to extract art work from them, then it checks all dirrectories where source media files are located and load all images from them, then you could manually Add artwork file from file or Paste from the clipboard (you could just do screenshot or copy image from web). 
AudioBookConverter verifies checksums of found art work images to avoid duplicates. Note: similar images or same image in different formats or different resolutions will not be detected automatically and you may want to remove them manually.
AudioBookConverter supports international encodings and symbols for output. However, some old mp3s may contain legacy encodings which may not be automatically detected by AudioBookConverter.

You don't need to keep same bitrate as mp3 has to preserve quality especially for audiobooks without music. E.g. mp3 books encoded at 128kbps, could be encoded into m4b with bitrate of 64kbps or into ogg with bitrate of 48kbps without significant degradation of quality. (Subject to quality of your source file, your hearing abilities nad your listening conditions)
Using cuttoff setting of the encoder you could remove frequencies higher than 8kHz which are not used in human speech. This will reduce size of the output file without significant degradation of speech quality. Note: Music quality might be affected by this setting.
AudioBookConverter can convert existing m4b files into mp3 splitting them by chapters. This is useful if you want to listen to your audiobooks on devices which do not support m4b format or chapters (i.e. Garmin watches). To do this open m4b file, switch to Chapters mode, in output setting select output format mp3 and select "Split by chapters"
To convert audiobook which you have on CD preserving maximum quality, you need to rip it first with 3rd Party software into lossless format: flac and cue. AudiobookConverter supports flac and cue files as input.
You can split audiobook into parts to limit size of single file. This is useful if your book is really large or if you convert book series in single run. Book split by parts will be seen as single book by most players, but will allow you to syncronise smaller files. To create new part, select the chapter where you would like to split book and press Split button. If you add more files in chapter mode, they will create new part.
You don't need to provide chapters information for your book you can press Start just after you add files. In this case AudioBookConverter will create single chapter for each file and will use last used settings for output.
Using Steam version of app you will automatically get the latest updates just downloading small delta. So, you don't need to re-download the full app manually and installing it again.
You can edit chapter information of existing m4b book. Open the book, switch to Chapters mode, select chapter and press Edit button. You can change chapter name using predefined settings, meta-information or use custom chapter name. You can also move chapters up and down by selecting chapter and pressing Move Up or Move Down button.
When editing a chapter you could apply chapter settings to all chapters. This is useful if you want to change chapter name template for all chapters.
Starting from version 6.3.1 encoding will be about 50% slower, but should give much better quality
In chapters mode you can split track into sub-tracks not only at equal intervals, but at specific time, in case 1 track contains several chapters and you want cut track at specific time and make each sub-track a separate chapter.
You can play selected media file in file mode and in chapter mode. Note: you need to select specific file not the chapter
